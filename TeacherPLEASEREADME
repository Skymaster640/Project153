Hi. Now, if you try to load up this project. I'm pretty sure that it won't work because, as you may see.
The scuba diver is not in the project. That is because Github will not let the repository create with
the scuba diver's scene.bin file. So I hope that you may at least, look at the code to see if it is
acceptable. And if you want to take the long way, import the model on your own end to see if it works.
I also did not put in the fish or turtle models as they were not used in the project, but it still might not work without the models.
